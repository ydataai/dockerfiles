# Docker Images

Basically all the images generated by the team, used by the developers and/or data scientists.

Find the public images on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ydata)

# Build locally

```
cd docker-compose/
```

Edit the `.env` file with:

```
TAG=(anything)
```

You can leave the registries empty:

```
PUBLIC_REGISTRY=
PRIVATE_REGISTRY=
```

Otherwise, please finish the regsitry with the slash `/` like: `docker.io/ydata/`

You can build all the images (cpu and gpu) at once:

```
./build-all.sh
```

Or, if you want to build just a set os images, run:

```
docker-compose -f {yaml_file} build
```

All the `.yaml` files contains the full path of images to make the build possible.
